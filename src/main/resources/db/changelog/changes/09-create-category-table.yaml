                    Mystery is a fiction genre where the nature of an event, usually a murder or other crime,
                    remains mysterious until the end of the story. Often within a closed circle of suspects,
                    each suspect is usually provided with a credible motive
                    and a reasonable opportunity for committing the crime.
